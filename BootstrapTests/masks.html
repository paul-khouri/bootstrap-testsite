    <h1>STUDY ‘ENDS DEBATE’ ON MASK BENEFITS</h1>
    <p>PANDEMIC Adam Taylor</p>
<div class=base> 
<p>
WASHINGTON: The authors of a study based on a vast randomised research project in Bangladesh say their results offer the 
best evidence yet that widespread wearing of surgical masks can limit the spread of the coronavirus in communities. 
</p>
</div>

        <div class="clearfix">
        <button type="button" class="btn float-right read-button">Read More</button>
        </div>
        <div class="extra" style="display: block;" id="extra-one">
        <p>The research paper, which tracked more than 340,000 adults in 600 villages in rural Bangladesh, 
        is the largest randomised study on the effectiveness of masks to limit the spread of coronavirus. </p>

        <p>Its authors say this provides conclusive , real-world evidence for what laboratory work and 
        other research already strongly suggest: mask-wearing can have a significant impact on 
        limiting the spread of symptomatic COVID-19 . 
        </p>
        </div>

<div class=base>
<p>''I think this should basically end any scientific debate about whether masks 
can be effective in combating COVID at the population level,'' Jason Abaluck, an 
economist at Yale who helped lead the study, said. 
</p>

<blockquote>It was ‘‘a nail in the coffin’’  of the arguments against masks. </blockquote>

<p>The researchers estimate that among a group of Bangladeshi adults in the study who were encouraged to 
wear masks, maskwearing increased by 28.8 per cent after the intervention. When tracked , this group saw a 
9.3 per cent reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 seroprevalence, meaning the virus was confirmed by bloodwork, 
as well as a further 11.9 per cent reduction in COVID-19 symptoms. 
</p>
</div>
        <div class="clearfix">
        <button type="button" class="btn float-right read-button">Read More</button>
        </div>
        <div class="extra" style="display: block;">
        <p>The study’s authors – which includes researchers from Yale, Stanford and the Bangladeshi nonprofit 
        GreenVoice – emphasised that this did not mean masks were only 9.3 per cent effective. </p>

        <p>‘‘ I think a big error would be to read this study and to say, ‘Oh, masks can only prevent 10 per cent of symptomatic infections,’ ’’ 
        Abaluck said. 
        The number would probably be several times higher if masking were universal, he said.</p> 

        <p>The study is under peer review with the journal Science. 
        The authors granted journalists an early look at the results because of their potential importance in global public health debates. 
        </p>
        </div>

<div class=base>
<p>Independent experts who were asked to look at the research praised its scale; 
some suggested that it might be the most convincing argument yet for mask-wearing . 
</p>

<p>‘‘ This is an incredibly challenging but important study to pull off,’’ said  
Megan Ranney, an emergency medicine physician and professor at Brown University who was not involved with this research.
 ‘‘ Antimask people keep saying, ‘Where’s the randomised controlled trial?’ Well, here you go.’’ 
</p>

        <p>
        ‘‘ It’s not just modelling or looking back at studies,’’ said Lawrence Gostin, 
        faculty director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, who also was not involved . 
        ‘‘ This is the gold standard of scientific knowledge.’’ 
        </p>
        <p>
        The sheer scale of the project, which began in November and concluded in April 2021, is notable. 
        About 178,000 Bangladeshi villagers were in an intervention group and encouraged to use masks. 
        An additional 163,000 were in a control group, where no interventions were made. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The project assessed the levels of mask-wearing and physical distancing through direct observations. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Mask-wearing had been mandated in Bangladesh since March 2020, though adoption remained limited. 
        The researchers found that they were able to increase maskwearing in the intervention group from 13 per 
        cent to 42 per cent – an increase of 28.8 percentage points. The effect 
        was observed and found to be consistent over 10 weeks and persisted after the interventions ended. 
        </p>
        </div>

<div class=base>
<p>
The group credited four interventions that helped increase mask usage in the community: 
providing nocost masks delivered door to door; offering information about the benefits of masks; 
reinforcement of mask-wearing ; and endorsement of masks by trusted local leaders. 
</p>
<p>
‘‘ I see no reason why the interaction between the mask and the virus will behave any 
differently in rural Bangladesh or rural Kansas or urban New York or San Francisco,’’ Gostin said. ‘‘ The biology is the same.’’
